# Breast Cancer Diagnostic

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Data Representation and Analysis" course (3rd semester of Computer Science). It focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes data analysis and visualization to identify patterns in medical data and improve diagnostic accuracy.

**Note:** This project is written in Polish.
